# room_prediction_model_frontend
A frontend framework for using a Machine Learning model deployed on Heroku.

To download the repo enter the command:

    git clone https://github.com/DarraghTate/room_prediction_model_frontend.git
    
To install the required packages, navigate to the room_prediction_model_frontend folder and enter the command:

    npm install
    
Once the packages are installed, you can run the application by entering the command:

    npm run serve

This will deploy the application on a localhost server.

This model predicts the number of people present in a room at a given time.

1st prediction may be slow, as Heroku may need to initialise the app again after dormancy,

To use, navigate to the folder and execute the command <b><i>npm run serve</i></b>.

Can be accessed online at <b><i>https://ait-user-prediction.herokuapp.com/</i></b>

Built as part of my placement (internship) in the Software Research Institute of Athlone Institute of Technology, Ireland.
